# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Study Tool is a comprehensive learning platform that allows students to upload various sources (PDFs, videos, websites, audio recordings, text) and interact with AI to enhance their studying experience. The platform provides a ChatGPT-like interface with specialized study tools including chat, notes, summaries, study guides, quizzes, flashcards, and AI-generated podcasts. The system organizes content hierarchically through folders containing studies, with each study containing multiple sources that the AI can reference for personalized learning assistance.
